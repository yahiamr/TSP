# Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer

## Introduction
This project is a p5.js visualization of a genetic algorithm solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP asks for the shortest possible route to visit a series of cities and return to the origin city. It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization.

## Features
- Interactive sliders to adjust the number of cities, population size, and mutation rate in real-time.
- Visualization of both the best path found so far and the current generation's best path.
- Implementation of genetic algorithm functions like fitness calculation, normalization, crossover, mutation, and generation of new populations.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the visualization.

## Controls
- `Number of Cities Slider`: Adjust the number of cities in the TSP.
- `Population Size Slider`: Change the size of the genetic algorithm's population.
- `Mutation Rate Slider`: Modify the mutation rate used in the genetic algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- p5.js Library
